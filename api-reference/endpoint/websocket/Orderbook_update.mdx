### To keep a local copy of the order book, please follow the steps below:

1. Open a market data stream and subscribe to orderbookupdate@{symbol}@{depth}

2. Buffer the updates you receive from the stream

3. Get an order book snapshot from https://api.woo.org/v3/public/orderbook?symbol=PERP_BTC_USDT&maxLevel={depth}.

4. Start processing any updates where prevTs = timestamp in the snapshot

5. Check prevTs of each newly processed update is the same as the ts of the previous update

6. If you receive a price level with 0 size, delete that price level

7. If you receive a price level that does not exist, insert that price level and size

8. If you receive a price level that already exists, update that price level with the new size
