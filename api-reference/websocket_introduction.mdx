Users need to be authenticated before subscribing to any topic. They would be disconnected if authentication fails. Refer to Authenticaton for more information.

### Authentication
The public market data topics do not require authentication.  The following only applies to private user data topics.

Refer to [API Authentication](/api-reference/authentication)  for more details about how to sign the request with api_key and api_secret.  The request method, request path and request body are all blank.  The message to sign is therefore just the timestamp.

| Name  | Type   | Required | Description |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| apikey | string | Y        | API key   |
| sign | string   | Y        | Signature   |
| timestamp | string | Y        | Timestamp   |
